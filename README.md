# professional-employee-portfolio

## Challenge Description

For this project, it is required to create a potential employee's deployed professional portfolio that stores and showcases work samples for employer's to access when looking for possible candidates. Portfolios are useful to demonstrate how potential candidates present their work and their experience in coding. For this portfolio, both HTML and CSS are used to create a responsive employee portfolio that showcases my work. 


## User Story

AS AN employer<br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples<br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work<br>
WHEN I load their portfolio<br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them<br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section<br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work<br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications<br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application<br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others<br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications<br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application<br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices<br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport<br>

## The Result
To satify this criteria, the site uses HTML/CSS structural semantics to reflect the following:
* A functional navigation bar that users can scroll to be presented with information about me, projects I have completed and my Contact details
* It presents a photo and my name
* An 'About Me' section highlighting my goals
* A responsive grid/web application section showcasing previous projects
* Footer to close off the page
